    IPA configuration option ``quiet-cleanup`` makes it possible to supress
    the Python exceptions during the execution of the disk metadata cleanup.
    The default value for ``quiet-cleanup`` is ``false``. The option can be
    configured via kernel parameters such as ``ipa-quiet-cleanup=<yourvalue>``.
